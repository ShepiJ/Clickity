# Clickity

I created this project to automate tasks and learn more about Python.

# How It Works

Just place the images you want the autoclicker to click in the templates folder. It's best to avoid moving backgrounds, as this can make it harder for the program to accurately click stuff.

# Customization

Feel free to modify the code to suit your needs. I've included batch files (.bat) to help automate compilation and install dependencies for those who might not be familiar with this stuff.

# Disclaimer

This is just an autoclicker; I am not responsible for any malicious intent resulting from the use of this code.
